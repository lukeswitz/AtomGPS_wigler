## Flashing to AtomGPS
- **Grab the codebase:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lukeswitz/AtomGPS_wigler.git
    cd AtomGPS_wigler/build
    ```

### Method One: [Esptool.py](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/)

**1. Locate the device:**
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     ls /dev/ttyUSB*
     # or
     ls /dev/cu.*
     ```
   - Windows, check COM port in Device Manager.

**2. Flash the firmware, partition and bootloader:**

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have the latest version of esptool.py installed from the link above, or a known warning about header fields will display when flashing.

  - Navigate to the build folder (if not already there).   
  - Flash using the following command **inside the build folder or by specifying file paths:**

`esptool.py -p [YOUR_PORT] -b 1500000 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 80m 0x1000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_5.bootloader.bin 0x8000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_5.partitions.bin 0x10000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_5.bin`
